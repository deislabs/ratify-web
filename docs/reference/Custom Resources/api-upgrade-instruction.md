# API Upgrade Instructions

It's normal and inevitable to move CRD APIs to newer versions as the project 
moves to a more stable stage. This doc lists the steps for the first version 
bump-up from `v1alpha1` to `v1beta1`, which can be referenced when we need to have 
new API versions in the future.

## Upgrade steps from `v1alpha1` to `v1beta1`
1.  Controller-runtime models conversion between versions in terms of a 
"hub and spoke" model. In Ratify, we mark the `unversioned` as the hub version, 
other versions(`v1alpha1` and `v1beta1`) as spoke versions. New versions would 
be added as spoke versions.

2. Create new API version by `kubebuilder` command:
```bash
kubebuilder create api --group config.ratify.deislabs.io --version v1beta1 --kind <kind>
```
kind could be `Store`, `Verifier` and `CertificateStore` respectively.

3. Copy over existing types from `v1alpha1` to `v1beta1`.

4. Create an `unversioned` API by manually copying the existing types from `v1alpha1` to 
`unversioned` as `kubebuilder` doesn't support `unversioned` as version value.

5. In each spoke version package, add marker `+k8s:conversion-gen` directive 
pointing to the hub(`unversioned`) version, which must be in `doc.go`. Example:
```go
// +k8s:conversion-gen=github.com/deislabs/ratify/api/unversioned
package v1alpha1
```

6. In hub(`unversioned`) version package, create `doc.go` and add marker `+kubebuilder:object:generate=true` so that the object generator can use it. Example:
```go
package unversioned
// +kubebuilder:object:generate=true
```

7. In spoke version packages, add a `localSchemeBuilder = runtime.NewSchemeBuilder(SchemeBuilder.AddToScheme)` in `groupversion_info.go` so the auto-generated code 
could compile.

8. In hub(`unversioned`) version package, add marker `+kubebuilder:skip` to each 
API and remove all other markers so that skip kubebuilder processing it.

9. Mark `v1beta1` as the storage version by adding marker `+kubebuilder:storageversion` 
to the root types. Example:
```go
// +kubebuilder:object:root=true
// +kubebuilder:resource:scope="Cluster"
// +kubebuilder:storageversion
// Store is the Schema for the stores API
type Store struct {
	metav1.TypeMeta   `json:",inline"`
	metav1.ObjectMeta `json:"metadata,omitempty"`

	Spec   StoreSpec   `json:"spec,omitempty"`
	Status StoreStatus `json:"status,omitempty"`
}
```

10. In the outdated spoke version package, add marker `+kubebuilder:deprecatedversion:warning=<msg>` to the root type of each API. Example:
```go
// +kubebuilder:object:root=true
// +kubebuilder:resource:scope="Cluster"
// +kubebuilder:deprecatedversion:warning="v1alpha1 of the Store API has been deprecated. Please migrate to v1beta1."
// Store is the Schema for the stores API
type Store struct {
	metav1.TypeMeta   `json:",inline"`
	metav1.ObjectMeta `json:"metadata,omitempty"`
	Spec   StoreSpec   `json:"spec,omitempty"`
	Status StoreStatus `json:"status,omitempty"`
}
```

11. Run `make manifests generate` to generate CRD objects, DeepCopy methods and conversion methods. `zz_generated.conversion.go` and `zz_generated.deepcopy.go` 
would be generated in each spoke version package.

## Additional steps while incompatibilities introduced

There is no real change between `v1alpha1` and `v1beta1`, which makes it easier 
than making incompatible upgrade. If there is an incompatible change introduced 
in a new version, we could follow the above 11 steps first and then follow the 
below instruction. Let's take the example of adding a new `Test` field to `StoreSpec`.

1. Add a string field `Test` to `StoreSpec` in both `unversioned` and new version(`v1beta1`) packages.

2. After executing `make manifests generate`, we would get errors similar to:
```
E0308 02:20:37.752749 4053005 conversion.go:756] Warning: could not find nor generate a final Conversion function for github.com/deislabs/ratify/api/unversioned.StoreSpec -> github.com/binbin-li/ratify/api/v1alpha1.StoreSpec
E0308 02:20:37.752867 4053005 conversion.go:757]   the following fields need manual conversion:
E0308 02:20:37.752874 4053005 conversion.go:759]       - Test
```
It means that we need to manually implement the conversion method from `unversioned` 
to `v1alpha1`.

3. Check the generated `zz_generated.conversion.go` in `v1alpha1` package, we 
could see errors indicating that `Convert_unversioned_StoreSpec_To_v1alpha1_StoreSpec()` 
was not declared. Now we could create a new file `store_conversion.go` in `v1alpha1` 
package, and implement this method manually there to resolve the error.

## Upgrade existing objects to a new stored version
It's safe to use both the old and new versions after upgraded. But if we really 
want to migrate stored objects to the new version, please follow the instruction:
